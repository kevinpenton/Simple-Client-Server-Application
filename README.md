Problems I Ran Into and Solutions:

 P: Understanding the functionality of command-line parameter processing and how to implement it on my project
 S: I used 'Source 1', a YouTube video, to help me understand how to properly utilize argv arguments as the 3 parameters I 
 needed: host, port and fileName

 P: Understanding how to read and work with binary files
 S: 'Source 2' helped me understand how reading files work and wether you want to only read them or write on them and in 
 what format you want the file, wether it is decoded or encoded.  

 P: How to close or process for loops and while loops in Python?
 S: 'Source 3' helped me understand better how while loops and for loops work on Python and how we can process them and 
 close them. It was very helpful when dealing with the iterations of each connection and helped me come up with the idea of 
 implementing a continue statement when dealing with the exception on my project to accept the next connection when an 
 error ocurred on one of them.

 P: How reading a binary file works and how to decode or encode a buffer?
 S: 'Source 4' taught the proper format when reading a binary file and writing bytes a binary file, it usually implements 
 the format open('filename, 'wb') where filename is the name of the file you want to open and the w stands for write if you 
 want to write on the file (or r for read if you want to read the file), the b on the other hand stand for bytes which is 
 the format on which you want to read the file (it makes sure is not encoded automatically).

 P: General information
 S: 'Source 5' I implemented primarily as a reference source to guide on how to properly receive and send information when 
 dealing with socket programming on python. It also taught me a bit about the different types of sockets, and how encoding 
 and decoding works when dealing with buffers.

 P: How to implement blocking and non-blocking sockets with the appropriate format in Python?
 S: 'Source 6' taught me more about blocking and non-blocking sockets and when to implement each of them. The source also 
 talks about their functionalities and respective advantages and disadvantages. It also offers snippets of code on how to 
 use them and how the proper format and syntax. 

 P: How reading a binary file works and how to decode or encode a buffer?
 S: 'Source 7' helped me refresh my knowledge regarding threading and how to properly thread a function for accepting and 
 processing multiple connections at the same time.
